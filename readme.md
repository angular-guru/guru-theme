# Guru Theme

To get started using the Guru Bootstrap theme in your application, simply install the package using NPM or Yarn by running the following command:

```
npm install @angular-guru/guru-theme
```

The stylesheet will now be available under `node_modules/@angular-guru/guru-theme/dist/theme.css`. Include this file in your application to apply the theme.

The pre-built theme comes with Bootstrap, however if you wish to customize the theme further, you may import the `_variables.scss` file and override the values.
